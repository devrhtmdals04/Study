      <description>&lt;p&gt;A major application of linear algebra is to solving systems of linear equations. This lecture presents three ways of thinking about these systems. The &amp;ldquo;row method&amp;rdquo; focuses on the individual equations, the &amp;ldquo;column method&amp;rdquo; focuses on combining the columns, and the &amp;ldquo;matrix method&amp;rdquo; is an even more compact and powerful way of describing systems of linear equations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook. However, this book is still the best reference for more information on the topics covered in each lecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some vectors &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; the equation &lt;em&gt;Ax&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; has solutions and for others it does not. Some vectors &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; are solutions to the equation &lt;em&gt;Ax&lt;/em&gt; = 0 and some are not. To understand these equations we study the column space, nullspace, row space and left nullspace of the matrix &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we learned last session, vectors don&amp;rsquo;t have to be lists of numbers. In this session we explore important new vector spaces while practicing the skills we learned in the old ones. Then we begin the application of matrices to the study of networks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By approaching what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from new directions, the questions in this exam review session test the depth of your understanding. This unit reached the key ideas of subspaces—a higher level of linear algebra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <guid>/resources/lecture-14-orthogonal-vectors-and-subspaces/data.json</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vectors are easier to understand when they&amp;rsquo;re described in terms of orthogonal bases. In addition, the Four Fundamental Subspaces are orthogonal to each other in pairs. If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is a rectangular matrix, &lt;em&gt;Ax&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; is often unsolvable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <guid>/resources/lecture-15-projections-onto-subspaces/data.json</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We often want to find the line (or plane, or hyperplane) that best fits our data. This amounts to finding the best possible approximation to some unsolvable system of linear equations &lt;em&gt;Ax&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;. The algebra of finding these best fit solutions begins with the projection of a vector onto a subspace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <guid>/resources/lecture-16-projection-matrices-and-least-squares/data.json</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Linear regression is commonly used to fit a line to a collection of data. The method of least squares can be viewed as finding the projection of a vector. Linear algebra provides a powerful and efficient description of linear regression in terms of the matrix &lt;em&gt;A_&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;_A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many calculations become simpler when performed using orthonormal vectors or orthogonal matrices. In this session, we learn a procedure for converting any basis to an orthonormal one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <guid>/resources/lecture-18-properties-of-determinants/data.json</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The determinant of a matrix is a single number which encodes a lot of information about the matrix. Three simple properties completely describe the determinant. In this lecture we also list seven more properties like det_AB_ = (det_A_)(det_B_) that can be derived from the first three.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One way to compute the determinant is by elimination. In this lecture we derive two related formulas for the determinant using the properties from last lecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <guid>/resources/lecture-2-elimination-with-matrices/data.json</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This session introduces the method of elimination, an essential tool for working with matrices. The method follows a simple algorithm. To help make sense of material presented later, we describe this algorithm in terms of matrix multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <guid>/resources/lecture-20-cramers-rule-inverse-matrix-and-volume/data.json</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now we start to use the determinant. Understanding the cofactor formula allows us to show that &lt;em&gt;A_&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = (1/det_A&lt;/em&gt;)_C_&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; is the matrix of cofactors of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;. Combining this formula with the equation &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;A_&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;_b&lt;/em&gt; gives us Cramer&amp;rsquo;s rule for solving &lt;em&gt;Ax&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;. Also, the absolute value of the determinant gives the volume of a box.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the product &lt;em&gt;Ax&lt;/em&gt; points in the same direction as the vector &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, we say that &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;eigenvector&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors describe what happens when a matrix is multiplied by a vector. In this session we learn how to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <guid>/resources/lecture-22-diagonalization-and-powers-of-a/data.json</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We know how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In this lecture we learn to diagonalize any matrix that has &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; independent eigenvectors and see how diagonalization simplifies calculations. The lecture concludes by using eigenvalues and eigenvectors to solve difference equations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <guid>/resources/lecture-23-differential-equations-and-exp-at/data.json</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this lecture we apply linear algebra to solve differential equations. We also talk about matrix exponential e_&lt;sup&gt;At&lt;/sup&gt;_. We can copy Taylor&amp;rsquo;s series for e_&lt;sup&gt;At&lt;/sup&gt;_ to define e_&lt;sup&gt;At&lt;/sup&gt;_ for a matrix &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;. If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is diagonalizable, we can use Λ to find the exact value of e_&lt;sup&gt;At&lt;/sup&gt;_.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like differential equations, Markov matrices describe changes over time. Once again, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors describe the long term behavior of the system. In this session we also learn about Fourier series, which describe periodic functions as points in an infinite dimensional vector space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Special matrices have special eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Symmetric and positive definite matrices have extremely nice properties, and studying these matrices brings together everything we&amp;rsquo;ve learned about pivots, determinants and eigenvalues. In this session we also practice doing linear algebra with complex numbers and learn how the pivots give information about the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In calculus, the second derivative decides whether a critical point of &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) is a minimum. For functions of multiple variables, the test is whether a matrix of second derivatives is positive definite. In this session we learn several ways of testing for positive definiteness and also how the shape of the graph of &lt;em&gt;ƒ&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) = &lt;em&gt;x_&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;_Ax&lt;/em&gt; is determined by the entries of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a final discussion of positive definite matrices, we learn about &amp;ldquo;similar&amp;rdquo; matrices: &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;M_&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;_AM&lt;/em&gt; for some invertible matrix &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;. Square matrices can be grouped by similarity, and each group has a &amp;ldquo;nicest&amp;rdquo; representative in &lt;em&gt;Jordan normal form&lt;/em&gt;. This form tells at a glance the eigenvalues and the number of eigenvectors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The singular value decomposition of a matrix is usually referred to as the SVD. This is the final and best factorization of a matrix. The factors are orthogonal matrix, diagonal matrix, orthogonal matrix. Any matrix whatsoever has this singular value decomposition. One thing we bring together in this lecture is the very good family of matrices that we just studied: symmetric, positive, definite.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we multiply a matrix by an input vector we get an output vector, often in a new space. We can ask what this &amp;ldquo;linear transformation&amp;rdquo; does to all the vectors in a space. In fact, matrices were originally invented for the study of linear transformations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Video cameras record data in a poor format for broadcasting video. To transmit video efficiently, linear algebra is used to change the basis. But which basis is best for video compression is an important question that has not been fully answered!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiz 3 covers the understanding of matrices through their eigenvalues. Elimination is history now, because it does NOT preserve eigenvalues. Notice the special types of matrices (like positive definite) and their factorizations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to &amp;ldquo;invert &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; to solve &lt;em&gt;Ax&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; may have only a left inverse or right inverse (or no inverse). This discussion of how and when matrices have inverses improves our understanding of the four fundamental subspaces and of many other key topics in the course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This session explains inverses, transposes and permutation matrices. We also learn how elimination leads to a useful factorization &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;LU&lt;/em&gt; and how hard a computer will work to invert a very large matrix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To account for row exchanges in Gaussian elimination, we include a permutation matrix P in the factorization &lt;em&gt;PA&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;LU&lt;/em&gt;. Then we learn about vector spaces and subspaces; these are central to linear algebra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This lecture discusses column space and nullspace. The column space of a matrix &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; tells us when the equation &lt;em&gt;Ax&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; will have a solution &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;. The nullspace of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; tells us which values of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; solve the equation &lt;em&gt;Ax&lt;/em&gt; = 0.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We apply the method of elimination to all matrices, invertible or not. Counting the pivots gives us the rank of the matrix. Further simplifying the matrix puts it in reduced row echelon form R and improves our description of the nullspace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When does &lt;em&gt;Ax&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; have solutions &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, and how can we describe those solutions? We describe all solutions to &lt;em&gt;Ax&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; based on the free variables and special solutions encoded in the reduced form R.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for vectors to be independent? How does the idea of independence help us describe subspaces like the nullspace? A basis is a set of vectors, as few as possible, whose combinations produce all vectors in the space. The number of basis vectors for a space equals the dimension of that space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook.
