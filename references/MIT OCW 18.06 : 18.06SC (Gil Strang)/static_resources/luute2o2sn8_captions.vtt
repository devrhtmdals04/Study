[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:00:02.137 --> 00:08:44.078


00:08:44.078 --> 00:08:44.870
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.715
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:57.880


00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.380
OK.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.750


00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.096
Thank you for coming today.

00:09:05.096 --> 00:09:09.620
It's sort of an overwhelming
day, but a happy one.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.630
So you know That there'll be
a few people speaking as well

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.340
as the ordinary class.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.290
So the first is Alan, Professor
Edelman, Alan Edelman,

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:26.120
the creator of Julia, who
had the idea for this event

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.760
but is out of the country,
now at a conference.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:37.730
So what I'm hoping to do now
is to introduce him by Zoom.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:42.770
And so, hopefully, he
will come on the screen

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:43.760
for a few minutes.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.220
Then I'll talk about
linear algebra--

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.560
I hope that's OK--

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.660
for most of the hour.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.620
And then at the end of the
hour, one of my PhD students

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.480
and Pavel Grinfeld
and then the chair

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:05.460
of the math department, Michel
Goemans, will end the class.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:11.780
So apologies to
the 18.06 class who

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.840
wants preparation
for the final exam,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.050
but I'll do some of
that in the middle.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.810
So, first of all,
if the system is

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:27.910
ready to send Alan's
message, they could go ahead.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.680
ALAN EDELMAN: Today this is a
special moment in MIT history.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.340
GILBERT STRANG: Oh, good.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.440
ALAN EDELMAN: It is fitting
that gathered together today

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.960
are young students completing
their first linear algebra

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.730
class together
with those who have

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.910
been inspired by Gil Strang for
perhaps over half a century.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.000
Gil, you recognize in everyone
the thirst for knowledge.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.250
You always bring out
the best in everybody,

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.320
and you do so with
dignity and humility.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.310
I've watched Gil encourage
everybody, no matter who.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.880
Whether a student was struggling
or at the top of the class,

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.670
Gil always knew
just what to say.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.230
Whether you were
a colleague right

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.080
next door or a stranger
that landed in the hallways,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.680
one feels that Gil is your
old or new best friend.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.307
So what makes Gil's
lecture so very special?

00:11:09.307 --> 00:11:10.140
GILBERT STRANG: Ooh.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.557
ALAN EDELMAN: I
think we might all

00:11:11.557 --> 00:11:12.890
agree that words fall short.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.620
And yet, we all know
how wonderful they are.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.438
Gil was a YouTube
star even before there

00:11:17.438 --> 00:11:18.605
was such a thing as YouTube.

00:11:18.605 --> 00:11:19.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.100
I love his words,
his tone, his pace.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.870
And the very way
that the answer seems

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.300
like a surprise, when,
of course, we all know he

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.200
rigged it from the beginning.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.200
I'd like to say something
particularly wonderful

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.880
about Gil's textbooks.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.060
The simple examples lead
to deep understanding.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.340
The good abstractions
from the deeper classes

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.260
are in Gil's text,
but yet, they are made

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.330
accessible the Gil Strang way.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.720
You can still find vector
spaces, subspaces, dimensions,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.750
the Perron-Frobenius theorem,
and linear transformations.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.730
All those goodies from
pure linear algebra

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.340
are not lost, just
made more relevant.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.650
I love watching how he
weaves those deeper ideas

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.090
into the flow of the class.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.610
Gil sneaks in the real spirit
of this beautiful mathematical

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.370
subject, and it's for everybody.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.070
Speaking of the textbooks, I
have a personal story to share.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.960
Some years ago, Gil
was going out of town

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.930
and had two tickets to an event
he didn't want to go to waste.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.570
He gave us the instructions
on how to unlock his home.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.820
But still, my wife, eight
months pregnant at the time,

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.028
felt like the Wellesley
police would surely arrest us

00:12:16.028 --> 00:12:17.210
for breaking and entering.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.070
But then we saw
an amazing sight--

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.620
stacks and stacks of Gil's
linear algebra texts,

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.760
floor to ceiling.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.250
And somehow we, felt comforted
that we were in a place

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.780
that we belonged.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.900
Gil, we all love your books,
your videos, your lectures.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.640
You are a role model and friend.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.460
So congratulations on so
many fine class lectures.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.890
And not wishing to
see today as final,

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.570
I officially invite
you to guest lecture

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.200
in any of my classes or seminars
any time you might wish to.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.210
Today is a milestone,
and I am honored

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.046
to share this moment with you.

00:12:46.046 --> 00:12:46.838
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:12:46.838 --> 00:12:48.708
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:49.208
Wow.

00:12:49.208 --> 00:12:54.910


00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.310
Oh, thank you.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.010
Does that mean I have
to give another lecture

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:00.910
from his invitation?

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:01.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.400
This is the final one.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.100
And so let me say
a little about--

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.380
first, the most important
thing I have to say,

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:16.840
the most important, is to
thank Andrew Horning, who

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.830
has co-taught this course,
done far more than I have,

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.850
made it happen, got
us to this point.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:29.530
He's not feeling great today.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.360
He did so much.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:37.630
So I'm speaking to him and for
him to thank you for coming

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.300
and to thank him
for all he's done.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:49.180
So he really made
it possible to teach

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:54.110
this happy but large class.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.390
So thank you, Andrew.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.590


00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.030
So then I'm going to--

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.020
I feel a little responsible
to do some linear algebra,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.020
and part of my family
is here, so I'm

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.420
taking this chance
after all these years

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.175
to teach them some
linear algebra.

00:14:17.175 --> 00:14:18.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.100


00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.290
And you might be
interested to know--

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.970
I don't know if you are--

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.610
how many years it's been.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.430
So I'll do that over here
and then maybe erase it

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.275
because it's a lot.

00:14:31.275 --> 00:14:32.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:40.180
OK, so on the faculty,
it's 61 years now today.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:40.680
Yeah.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.636
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

00:14:41.636 --> 00:14:43.526
Yeah.

00:14:43.526 --> 00:14:44.026
Yeah.

00:14:44.026 --> 00:14:47.380


00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:51.070
And then prior to that, I was
an instructor for 2 years.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.840
You see, I remember all these.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:00.790
And then I was an MIT student
before this room existed,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.890
but I was a math major.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.200
There were about eight
math majors then,

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.230
and now there are hundreds.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.540
It's just been fantastic.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.470
So that was 3 years.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.470
So that's 66, and I'm--

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.470
you too will be happy
to know that it's

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:25.130
66 out of my 88 years.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.440
So what a nice fraction.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.260


00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:34.850
So 3/4 of my life at MIT.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:35.350
Yeah.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.640
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.870


00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.520
OK.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.050
OK, so I'm going to begin by
solving some linear equations.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.190
Those are linear--

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.210
I'm now speaking to family and--

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:58.680
but speaking to you
all, just only the class

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.290
certainly will know this.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.680
So that's three equations.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.040
And there are three
unknowns, x, y, and z,

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.210
and the goal is to find those
three numbers, x, y, and z.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.300
So this is maybe the
most standard problem

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.030
in linear algebra--

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.520
n equations and n unknowns.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.070
In this example, n equals 3.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.530
So how do we proceed?

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.960
How do we find x, y, and z?

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:33.990
Well, the idea comes thousands
of years ago in China,

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.680
and the key word is elimination.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.890
We don't any 0's there.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:47.280
It's 0's that make
calculations easier.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.240
And so let me show you how--

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:51.945
the steps.

00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:57.240


00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.420
For those who know it well--
so the first equation,

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.460
I won't change--

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:08.670
2x plus 3y plus 4z equal 19.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.500


00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.598
What I want to get
is some 0's here.

00:17:13.598 --> 00:17:17.409
I want the second
equation to start with 0.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.210
So how do I do--

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.690
where I now have
a 4, I want a 0.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.190
So I have that equation set.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.870
And I subtract 2 times that
equation from this one.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:34.660
I choose that number, 2, so
the 2 times 2x will be 4x.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.030
And when I subtract,
I'll have a 0.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.580
So that, I multiply that by 2.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.280
So 2 times 3y is 6y, leaving 5y.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.170


00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:53.520
And 2 times 4z is 8z
from 14, leaving 60.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.200
And 2 times 19 is 38
from 55, leaving 17.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:17:59.970
OK.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.730
So we've got an
easier equation now,

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.280
and I'll do the same
for the third equation.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.910
This time, I have a 2x
there and a 2x there,

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.750
so I just want to subtract
that equation from this one

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:21.460
to make this 0x plus 3y
taken away from 8y leaves 5y.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.440
And 4z from 17z is 13z.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.640
And 19 from 50 is 31.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.310
OK, so we've taken
the first step.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:40.130
We've got 0's in the first
column below the pivot,

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:44.590
the number that we
used to get those 0's.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:51.330
OK, so I'm partway along, and
then the idea is to continue.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:59.870
And I now look at the
second and third equations.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.890
I have two equations here,
and they just involve y and z.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.340
So I'm making progress.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.950
I had three equations
with three unknowns.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.730
Now I have two equations
with two unknowns.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:16.370
And let's go to one
equation with one unknown.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:21.170
So I want to get
a 0 there, right,

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.840
so that I'll just have
z's and a right-hand side.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.220
So if I subtract,
everybody sees--

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.380
is sort of getting in the swim.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:36.440
If I subtract that equation from
this one, it'll be 0x 0y and--

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.280
what is it?

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:45.160
7z equal 17 from 31 is 14.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.110
OK, so now I have--

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:55.970
and so now I have an equation
for z all alone and equation

00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:01.460
for y and z together and the
starting equation for x, y,

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.940
and z all together.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.520
So what's next?

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.110
Go backwards.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:11.420
Solve this equation for z
then back to this one for y

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.940
and then back to this one for x.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:22.130
So this is called elimination,
and it was invented in China

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.240
3 or 4,000 years ago.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.440
So I'm sorry.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.700
This is a little
bit old mathematics,

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.170
but it's the basic
step that simplifies,

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.180
and then I'll show
you a little more.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.930
So let's go backwards.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.900
Maybe you could all
do it as I do it.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:48.330
If we solve that equation for
z, I get z equal to 2, right?

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:54.370
Divide by 7, and now if z
is 2, then 13z here is 26.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:58.160
So I have 5y and 26 and 31.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.110
Well, if I subtract
the 26 from the 31,

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:05.620
I'm moving the 26 over with
31 because it's just a number.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.600
So I'm subtracting
this 26 leaves

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.530
me 5, so I have 5y equal 5.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:18.720
So 5y equal 5 is what that
equation has become, and told

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.370
me that y is 1.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:27.730
And finally, I come
back to the top equation

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.220
because I now know y and z.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.000
So if z is 2, that's 8.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.760
If y is 1, that's 3.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.720
So I have 3 and 8
and 19 there, so I

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.430
should be able to figure out x.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.520


00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.650
Do you see what x is?

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.380
Yeah, let me-- this
is for the class, now.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.380
I got you this far
by elimination.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.310
So I have this equation
to solve for x,

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.540
and then I've got the answer.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.320
I've got all of x, y, and z.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.820
So what do I have?

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.310
The 4z is 8.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.560
3y, this is 3.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.135
And 2x is what?

00:22:10.135 --> 00:22:12.670


00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:13.170
AUDIENCE: 8.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:13.410
AUDIENCE: 8.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.410
GILBERT STRANG: 2x is 8?

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:15.570
Thanks.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:19.180
Professors need help,
especially at this point.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.460
2x is 8, so x is--

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:21.960
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.460
GILBERT STRANG: 4, Well done.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.300
100%, A for the whole class.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.810
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.010
OK, right.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.450
OK.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:40.450
So let me just say that,
if we were doing this

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:45.550
on the computer,
we wouldn't keep

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.460
repeating all these
letters, x and y and z,

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.910
and all the plus signs
and all the equal signs.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.100
I would write those equations--

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.460
or the original equations,
I would write as--

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.090
oh dear, that's out of sight.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.500
OK.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.690
So I would write the
original equations

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:18.350
as 2, 3, and 4, 4, 11,
and 14, 2, 8, and 17.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.490
So that's the--
there is the matrix,

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:26.440
the matrix of coefficients, the
matrix of the right-hand side--

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.570
of the numbers on
the right-hand side.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:34.570
And they multiply if we define
multiplication suitably.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.600
There, there's the
x, y, z unknown.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.000
So this is the matrix.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.530


00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:46.340
This is the unknown to find.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.570
This is the part to find.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:54.170
And then the right-hand
side is 19, 55, 50.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:59.210


00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:08.400
OK, so that's the way you would
write the equations in a matrix

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:08.900
form.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.120
So I've introduced you
to the idea of a matrix.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.990
This happens to be a square
matrix, three rows and three

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.980
columns.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:22.960
And that's because I have
three equations up there.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.560
Yeah.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:29.650
So all the operations that I
did would be done just directly

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:30.670
on the matrix--

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.700
subtract 2 of this
row away from this,

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.160
subtract that row away
from that, and so on.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.250
So this is the short-- you
could say the shorthand--

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.530
the idea of matrix
multiplication.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.980
You begin to get an idea
of how matrices multiply.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.230
When you realize
that first equation

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:57.320
comes from this along
with that and that.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.990
So the first equation
comes from the first row

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:08.020
times the unknowns equaling the
first number, 19, and so, yeah.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.860
So it would simplify to this.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.790
So this-- I'll
just repeat again.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:20.990
So 2, 3, 4-- we didn't change.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:25.190
This changed to 2, 5, 6.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:31.280
And this ultimately changed
to 0, 0, 7, I think.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.930
6 from 13.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.790
6 from 13 left 7.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:43.010
So the reduced
equation was this one.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:50.930
We had a 14 here, we had a 17
here, and we had a 19 here.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:55.390
So this is the original problem.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.120
This is the simplified problem.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.870
You see, we produced
a triangular matrix.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.100
And the unknowns are still safe.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.860
So we've written
that-- we've written

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.940
the-- using matrix notations
so that we didn't have to keep

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.320
writing pluses and so on.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:12.820
Yeah.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.160
So this is exactly
the same as that.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.840
And now how do we solve it?

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.160
Just thinking,
again, how solve it--

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.330
we came from top to
bottom as we went here.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:34.200
And now to solve, to find the
answer, we went bottom to top.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.320
We found z equal to 2.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.850
By the time we knew z, then the
next equation told us y was 1,

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.370
and finally, x was 4.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:51.190
So this led to the
answer, 4, 1, 2.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.290
OK, good.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:59.120
So that was three equations
and three unknowns.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:05.550
And linear algebra-- so
maybe the most common problem

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:11.070
in numerical computation is
solving a system of equations.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:16.530
And again, this equation had
the same number of equations,

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.890
three, as unknowns, three.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:24.670
So there was-- we expect one
solution, not always the case

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.130
but here, it worked.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:31.680
OK, so that's lesson 1.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:41.850
Let me do something similar
for a different problem.

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.020
It won't be a square
matrix this time.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.940
The matrix will be rectangular.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.850
So we may have many solutions.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.790
We may have no
solutions, all depending

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.720
on what the numbers are.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.440
So let me just write down--

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:04.900
so this is my second and
last example for the guests

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.960
and also for 18.06.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.020
OK, so now I'm
going to write down

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:16.750
the matrix A in the next
problem, new problem.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.760
Now, what's different
about this problem

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.000
is there are still going
to be three equations,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.980
but there will be four unknowns.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.900
So now I'm-- that extra unknown.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.750
Well, I don't even
necessarily have

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.270
to give the letters for it.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:37.480
I'm going to use this shorthand.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:44.100
So I now have a matrix
A. Matrices are always

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.670
A. There's not much
imagination required.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:29:01.330
11 and 37, I think, 3, 7, 37--

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.320
I think maybe that's 17.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.630
Sorry.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.190
Whoopsie.

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:18.430
37 and 57 and 4, 8, 48, and 74.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:22.530


00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.420
OK.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.110
So again, I'm using
this matrix shorthand,

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:31.990
so I'm not writing the equations
out, but I could this way.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:35.460
So there would be
three equations again,

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.820
and I need three
right-hand sides.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.250
Oh, I'm going to take the
right-hand sides to be 0.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:44.480


00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.490
So all I need is that matrix.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:53.420
So I'm calling this
matrix again a and I want

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.060
to multiply it by--

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.420
maybe I'd better number
of these x1, x2, x3, x4.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.230


00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.780
So that's a shorthand.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.050
A shorthand for that
would be x, a vector.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.370
And on the right-hand side,
I'm going to have 0's.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:16.620


00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.170
Ax equals to 0 vector.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:26.720
You see that I'm moving you
toward matrix vector notation

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.720
and beginning to
think more generally.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.500
So now we have a vector that's
in four-dimensional space.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.500
So we have to get used to that.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.300
All it means is that there are
four components to our vector.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.480
We can try to visualize
four-dimensional space,

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.030
but we don't have to.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:50.670
At this point, we're doing
algebra and not geometry,

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:53.290
and we can just go ahead.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.570
So what do you think?

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.600
Are there solutions
to this equation,

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.140
to these three
equations, I should say?

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.130
Are there any?

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:09.990
Can you think of any x1, x2,
x3, x4 that solve for equations?

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.010
Yes, I think you can.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.516
So what's one solution
that's sure to be here?

00:31:15.516 --> 00:31:16.450
AUDIENCE: All 0's.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.450
GILBERT STRANG: All 0's.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:18.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:26.310
So this equation stands for x1
plus 2 x2 plus 11 x3 plus 17 x4

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.360
equals 0.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.010
Something else equals 0.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:30.480
Something else equals 0.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:36.210
So I have three equations
and four unknowns.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.860
Yeah, so this is different.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:46.280
I have m equals 3 equations,
n equal 4 unknowns.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:52.720
And the right-hand side is 0.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.010
It's all 0's.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.650
So I do have solutions.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.620
The question is, do I have
any nonzero solutions,

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.930
any solutions that are not 0?

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.390
So how are we going to
discover the solutions?

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.040
And do we think in advance--

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.300
let's just make a guess
before I use these numbers.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:16.280
Do we think that there are
solutions other than all 0's?

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.430
Everybody sees that if--

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:24.450
are you visualizing this
also in the form of this?

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:30.620
This is saying, again, that x1
plus 2 x2 plus 11 x3 plus 17 x4

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.940
equals 0.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.840
And, of course, all
0's will be a solution.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.950
But we have only
three equations,

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:43.360
and we have four unknowns.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.311
So what do we know about the--

00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:52.290
there will be a solution,
then, and especially

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.860
with the 0's on the right side.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.590
So we have m equals 3.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:33:07.170
So one solution is x equal y
equal z equal 0 if all of these

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:09.180
multiply 0--

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.660
oh, sorry, x--

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:16.200
I have new names for them
because now I've got four.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.380
I kind of ran out of letters.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:24.360
So it's x1 equal x2 equal
x3 equal x4 equal 0.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.280
But we look for more.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.340


00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:34.630
Three equations, four unknowns,
we've got freedom here.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:40.810
We can expect to find
some nonzero x's.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.210
And the question is, how many?

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.030
And the question is-- and
we can only answer that

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.790
by simplifying the matrix.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:51.430
Just as we did there,
we'll simplify this

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.730
by subtracting equations
from other equations.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.350
OK so let me start
on that process.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:03.800
So one solution, but I'm
looking for more solutions.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.310


00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.810
OK.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.590


00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:15.690
So everybody in 18.06 now,
I'll speak to you guys first.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:19.310
So you know that we'll
do elimination again.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.489
That elimination process
will produce 0's here,

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:26.639
and we'll get to
see what's going on.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:30.120
So right now, we have three
equations, four unknowns.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:35.449
So we would sort of expect
maybe one family of solutions

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.400
because we've got
an extra unknown.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.820
But you can't tell until
you get into the numbers.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.290
OK.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:46.710
So now again, what
does elimination mean?

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:51.480
Elimination is take combinations
of the columns that produce

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.179
some 0's.

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:57.450
And I see one combination
of a column that produces,

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:00.600
one produces-- combinations of
the rows, I should have said--

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.050
combinations of the rows
that produce some 0's.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:07.560
And I see one
combination right away--

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:12.120
well, I built it in
there, so not surprising.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.310
I can see it, but
can you see it--

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.490
that will produce a lot of 0's.

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.310
I think that the 3--

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.890
there, that row and
that row and that row--

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:28.630
there's a connection between
them, and do you see it?

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:33.370
Do you see what's special about
the three rows of the matrix?

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.980
Those rows have four
components, so they're

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.550
popping off somewhere in
four-dimensional space,

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:42.670
but they're a bit special.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.995
And what's special there,
somebody could say?

00:35:44.995 --> 00:35:48.860


00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.270
Look at rows 1, 2, and 3 there.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:55.720
Do you see anything
connected there?

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.903
AUDIENCE: The first two
rows down to the third.

00:35:57.903 --> 00:35:59.320
GILBERT STRANG:
The first two rows

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.150
add to the third row, right.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.280
Row 1 plus row 2 is row 3.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.024
So row 3 is unnecessary.

00:36:07.024 --> 00:36:09.760


00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:15.070
I can subtract row 1 from
row 3 and row 2 from row 3,

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.990
and what will I then get?

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:18.940
I'll save myself writing.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:24.010
What will I get if I subtract
rows 1 and 2 from row 3?

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:24.740
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.110
GILBERT STRANG: All 0's, yes.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:32.400
So, suddenly, I'm in a
different situation here.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.640
I still have a--

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.400


00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.780
you all saw that the
numbers there were just--

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.100
it was a 74.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.270
This was a 48.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.280
This was the 9,
and that was a 4.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.900
And so now when I subtract the
first equation and the second

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.880
equation from the third, I've
got 0 equals 0, which I've--

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.830
that's perfect.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.610
No problem.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.120
It automatically
is going to give

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.140
the 0 on the right-hand side.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:07.470
So really, now, I have two
equations and four unknowns.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:11.790
Two equations and four unknowns,
so I'm expecting maybe--

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.790
4 minus 2 would
be two solutions.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.910
I'm expecting two
nonzero solutions.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.360
OK.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.490
So how do I get there?

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:28.300
I think I get more
0's in the matrix.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:28.800
OK.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.500


00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:40.770
So again, we're ready to work on
the problem, the given problem,

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:45.750
by subtracting suitable
multiples of a row

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:49.470
from another row because
I'm subtracting an equation

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:50.770
from an equation.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.730
So it leaves me with
a correct equation.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.380
OK, let me do that.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.740
So let me subtract--

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.170
I would like to get--

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.760
now you could help me.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.670
I'd like to get a 0 in
that position just the way

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.300
I did in the first problem.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.605
So how shall I get a
0 where I have a 3?

00:38:12.605 --> 00:38:14.210


00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:20.730
GILBERT STRANG: I'll subtract
3 times row 1 from row 2.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.410
So I'll keep row 1.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:25.680
And I won't keep writing
all the 0's and the x's.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.880
We understand that.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.380
It's only the numbers
here that matter.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:34.660
So I have 1, 2, 11, and 17.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.490
And I'm subtracting
3 times that.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:41.560
So 3 1's-- that made
the 0 that I want.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.330
3 2's is 6.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.580
Taken away from 7 is a 1.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.000
3 11's is 33.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.850
Take away from 37 just leaves 4.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.690
And 3 17's is 51 leaves 6.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:57.880
Do you agree with that?

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.460
And this row of all
0's is still here.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.202


00:39:03.202 --> 00:39:05.030
OK?

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.140
Good.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.170
Progress.

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:09.250
What else can I do?

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.830
So this is elimination.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:14.380
And now I'm going
to-- because I'm

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.600
dealing with a more
general problem,

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.870
I'm going to allow
elimination upwards.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:20.890
I want to get--

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:24.970
I want to subtract a multiple
of equation 2 from equation 1

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:28.910
and make it still simpler, OK?

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.100
So my 0--

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:35.400
0 equals 0 is no problem.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:40.880
This one, I'm keeping now
because it has that 0 that I

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.640
paid for with some computing.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.980
But now what do I want to do?

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.580
I want to subtract a multiple
of this from the top equation.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.520
So I'm working
upwards this time.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.910
Well, when I subtract this,
that'll still leave the 1,

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:58.470
but I would like
to get a 0 there.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:03.030
I want to get 0's because
then I can write out

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.570
the solution easily.

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:05.950
So what do I do?

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:09.090
What do I multiply row 2 by?

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.740
Everybody here is with me.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:15.510
I want to multiply row 2 by some
number and subtract from row 1

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.310
and get that 0.

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.590
So what do I multiply row 2 by?

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.130
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.140
GILBERT STRANG: 2, thank you.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.750
Everybody in this class
is going to have an A.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.662
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:26.662 --> 00:40:29.530
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:32.880


00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:38.550
I'm sorry to think that this
class is recorded, because I

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.050
didn't really mean it.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:42.816
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:42.816 --> 00:40:44.200


00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.220
I'll just say, you all
deserve an A. How's that?

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.720
That's a nice note.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.360
Yes, at least based
on so far today,

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.950
but there's more questions
on this final exam.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:57.220
So you have A so far.

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:57.720
OK.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:02.130
So I want to subtract this from
the row above to get that 0.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.470
What do I multiply this by?

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.280
2.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.040
Subtract from this,
so 2 1's is 2,

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.780
and the subtraction gives the 0.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.710
2 4's is 8, leaving 3.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:17.760
And 2 6's is 12, leaving 5.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.890
OK.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:23.920
So my equation is now--

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.220
my three equations are--

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.840
well, this is a
0-equals-0 equation.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:37.840
My equations are x1 from
the 1, no x2s, three x3's,

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:42.840
and five x4s equaling 0.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.840
The right side stayed 0
because it was always there.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:52.300
And the other equation
here is no x1's, 1 x2,

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:56.920
4 x3's, and 6 x4's.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.860


00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.110
OK.

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:07.450
So those equations are
equivalent to the first ones.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:11.110
I just did subtraction of
equation from equation.

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:14.560
That's totally safe,
and it's reversible.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.100
I could get from that back
to that by doing adding back.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:23.920
So that's just as good and, in
fact, better than the original.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.800
We ought to be
able to write down

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.960
the solutions for this one.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.810
And let me count--
what are we expecting?

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.600
Let's get a little
geometry in this.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:39.690
So I have-- I'm in
four-dimensional space.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.530
That's a challenge
right away to visualize

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.270
four-dimensional space.

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:47.210
But I have an x1, x2, x3, x4.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:52.120
So my solution vector
has four components.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:58.600
And so what are some solutions?

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.840
What are all the solutions
I'd like to know?

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.590
And notice one point,
that there's 0's

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.850
on the right-hand side.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:12.900
So that tells me if I find one
set of x's that works, then

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.660
2 times that set
of x's will work.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:20.790
5 times that set of x's
will work because it'll just

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:23.400
multiply all--

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.870
because I'll have 0 equals 0,
and I can safely multiply by 5.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:35.050
So I'm expecting two solutions,
two separate solutions.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:38.920
And I'll write those
maybe up above.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.070
x1, x2, x3, x4.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:46.250


00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.620
Yeah, so give me a--

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:53.210
so I have two equations,
and for these four unknowns,

00:43:53.210 --> 00:44:04.330
let me start out with a x3 equal
to a 1 and x4 equal to a 0.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:10.630
So I'm just sort of freely
setting x3 and x4 as 1 and 0.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:12.700
And then I'll figure
out or you'll figure out

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.310
what x1 and x2 have to be.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.830
So what's the answer, then?

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:25.550
If x3 is 1 and x4
is 0, what is x1?

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.560
And this is obviously 0.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.210
So what is x1?

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:32.375
That leads to x1 equal--

00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:35.550


00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:36.660
what x1?

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.100
AUDIENCE: Negative 3.

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.050
GILBERT STRANG:
Negative 3, thank you.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:40.920
And what's x2?

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.460


00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.590
That will come
from this equation.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.270
What will x2 be?

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:48.420
AUDIENCE: Negative 4.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.545
GILBERT STRANG: Negative 4.

00:44:49.545 --> 00:44:51.800


00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.980
So that's a solution.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.292
We've solved this original
problem-- aw, I erased it.

00:44:58.292 --> 00:45:01.490
It was much worse
at the beginning,

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.170
but we found a solution.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:08.610
But again, we have
four unknowns and we

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:14.310
have only two real equations,
two independent equations,

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.650
because this third equation
turned out to be a fraud.

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:20.580
It was just a
combination of 1 and 2.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:24.100
So we really have only two
equations, four unknowns.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.000
So we would expect
two solutions,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.050
and I found one of them.

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:32.360
OK, so that's good.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:36.020
So let me find the
other one, and then

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.820
this problem is solved,
and we can go on.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:45.320
So another solution-- I want
to find another x1, x2, x3,

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:52.190
and x4, and tell me
what it-- so this time,

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:55.600
I'll start with 0
and 1 for these guys.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.420
I'll let that be
0 and that be 1.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.770
And then I'll use the
equations to tell me x1 and x2,

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.890
or you will.

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.205
So now what is x1
from this equation?

00:46:08.205 --> 00:46:09.450
AUDIENCE: Minus 5.

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:11.760
GILBERT STRANG: Minus 5, thanks.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.890
This is minus 5.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:17.724
And what is x2
from this equation?

00:46:17.724 --> 00:46:20.088
AUDIENCE: Negative--

00:46:20.088 --> 00:46:21.130
GILBERT STRANG: Negative?

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:21.545
AUDIENCE: 6.

00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:21.960
AUDIENCE: Negative 6.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.220
GILBERT STRANG: Negative 6.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:28.350
OK, we found two solutions,
clearly independent-- minus 3,

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.450
minus 4, 1, 0.

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.430
That's a vector in
four dimensions.

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:33.720
We're in four dimensions.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.810


00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:40.290
Linear algebra has no problem
to go up in dimension.

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:41.700
It stays linear.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.470
That's what keeps things simple.

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:46.350
And then it goes up to
any number of dimensions.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:49.680
And so these would
be typical problems

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:56.420
coming from some
engineering system, some--

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.280


00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.430
yeah, so we have two solutions,
and that's somehow right.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:07.100
And any combination of
those is a solution.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:08.860
So I have actually--

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:13.420
if I combine one of this
solution plus 6 of that

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.930
solution, I'd have another
solution because, on the right

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:20.230
side, I would just
have still all 0's.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:26.350
OK, so that problem is solved,
that for, and that, as we

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:27.340
expected.

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.720
And let's just review.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:38.510
So I have-- I started with
three rows and four columns.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:42.470
But the three rows
were not independent.

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:45.380
The three equations-- a
combination of the three

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.060
equations gave me a 0.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:51.170
So I really had the
rank of the matrix is 2.

00:47:51.170 --> 00:48:00.530
So this is a matrix with m
equal 3 rows, n equal 4 columns,

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:06.890
but the rank of
the matrix is what?

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:11.420
Now, everybody, if you don't
know what the word "rank" is,

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.820
let the 18.06 tell you.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.900
What's the rank of my matrix?

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.400
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.930
GILBERT STRANG: 2,
oh, you do know.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:18.680
Yeah, OK.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:19.970
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.240
GILBERT STRANG:
So its rank is 2.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.880
So its row rank is 2.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.593
Now the most wonderful
theorem in linear algebra--

00:48:28.593 --> 00:48:30.260
and the most wonderful
theorem, at least

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.180
at the beginning
of linear algebra,

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:36.950
is that if I have two
independent rows--

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:39.500
and that's what I have,
two independent rows.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.620
The third row was a
combination, didn't count.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.340
So I had two independent
rows, so the row rank is 2.

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.720
And now look at the columns.

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.140
So I had originally
four columns.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.940
I still have four columns.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.640
I didn't mess with combinations.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:00.710
How many independent
columns do I have?

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:04.700
How many-- yeah,
look at this matrix.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.490
Look at this matrix,
because nothing--

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:08.600
these numbers didn't change.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.650
Look at that matrix.

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:16.340
So that has 1, 2, 3, 4 columns,
but they're not independent.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.970
Some of those columns are
combinations of other columns.

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:24.180
That's what the beginning
of linear algebra is about.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:28.770
And what's the answer
to the column rank?

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:33.050
So the column rank is the
number of independent columns.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:35.390
And what do I get for that?

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:36.590
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:38.000
GILBERT STRANG: 2, thank you.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.090
That's a great,
first, wonderful,

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.880
not-at-all-clear fact.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.880
If I went back to
the original matrix

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.670
and said there are
two independent rows,

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:55.550
and then math told me that there
were two independent columns,

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:59.810
well, I would believe it
because it gets proved in 18.06,

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:06.050
but this is a great fact, that
the number of independent rows

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:09.160
matches the number of
independent columns.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.200
OK, I think it's--

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:18.260
I thought there'd be time for
some more review of old finals.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:22.030
This could have been
on a final, and--

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:23.957


00:50:23.957 --> 00:50:25.040
GILBERT STRANG: Let's see.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.400
Do you want to answer
me one question?

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.990
Oh, no, you don't.

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:31.880
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:36.800
I think it's the
right time to ask

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.750
Pavel Grinfeld, who was
one of my first early PhDs,

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:43.940
to say a few words.

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.760
And then if Professor
Goemans is here--

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.840
he's here, OK.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.730
So Pavel, thanks.

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:52.230
Thank you.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.688
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

00:50:55.688 --> 00:50:59.146


00:50:59.146 --> 00:51:00.630
PAVEL GRINFELD: Hi.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:02.950
This is the mic, right?

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:03.700
Hi.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:07.297
So I wrote down some thoughts,
so please don't be worried.

00:51:07.297 --> 00:51:08.380
This is not a long speech.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:09.550
It's just a very large font.

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:10.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:15.160
And so and I just want to say--
this is not in the speech.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:18.400
I was sitting over there,
and I was looking back

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.310
most of the time at this
sea of beautiful faces.

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:23.740
And I was just
thinking to myself,

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:27.820
your faces are so beautiful not
only because you're so young

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.335
and have such amazing hair--

00:51:29.335 --> 00:51:30.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:32.320
--and not only because
you're accomplished

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.360
enough to be taking
linear algebra so

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.840
early in your college careers,
but also because you're

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.640
in Gil's presence.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.620
And when you're
in Gil's presence,

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:45.020
you're just in a better,
more beautiful world,

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:48.790
and I think that your
faces are channeling that.

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:53.170
So that's just what
it's like knowing Gil.

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:57.430
And I think that's why I
chose to pursue the same line

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:00.010
of studies as Gil, and it has--

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:03.430
Gil's presence in my
life has informed so many

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:04.220
of my decisions.

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:07.450
So anyway, so that's just
some thoughts that I had.

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:08.920
Now I'll get to my speech.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.980
And first, I want to say
congratulations, Gil,

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.106
on your retirement.

00:52:14.106 --> 00:52:15.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:19.364
GILBERT STRANG:
[CHUCKLES] Thank you.

00:52:19.364 --> 00:52:22.250


00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:23.750
PAVEL GRINFELD: Now
you will finally

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:25.790
have some time to
concentrate on your research.

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:27.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.970
And we all owe you
a debt of gratitude

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:34.070
for everything you've done.

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:38.210
But my life, especially,
has been touched by you.

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:40.190
So all I want to
do is just share

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.920
a few of my personal
experiences.

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.900
So if I think back to one of the
most important days in my life,

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.640
it was the day that
I passed my qual.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.970
And it wasn't because
I passed my qual.

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:55.730
It's because when you
said, congratulations,

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:59.270
and I said, thank you,
Professor Strang, you said,

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:02.130
I think that, going forward,
Gil is more appropriate.

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:03.005
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.

00:53:03.005 --> 00:53:03.505
[LAUGHS]

00:53:03.505 --> 00:53:04.980
PAVEL GRINFELD:
And in that moment,

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.190
I felt like I've made it.

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:13.130
And to this day, I look
back on that day as the day

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:14.810
that I've made it.

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:16.460
That's just how
much it means to me

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:19.710
to be on the first-name
basis with you.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:22.400
And speaking of
your name, I have

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.865
to confess that I namedrop
your name all the time.

00:53:25.865 --> 00:53:27.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:29.810
So, for example, if somebody
asks me for a linear algebra

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:33.170
textbook recommendation,
I say, well,

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:36.890
I might be biased because
he was my advisor,

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:39.260
but I recommend Strang's book.

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.170
And I understand it takes
away from the recommendation

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:44.630
a little bit, but
that's just how

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:48.950
proud I am to be your student.

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:51.540
Now, this is very personal.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.750
I want to say a few
words about your office.

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:58.610
When I'm in your office, to me,
it's like an oasis of peace.

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:03.650
And I feel like the zero-sum
world is left at the door

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:08.120
and that only good things
can happen while I'm there.

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:12.140
And I just still remember
sitting in front of your desk

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:15.150
and the stacks of
papers and books.

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:18.320
It looks like the late
stages of the game, Jenga,

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.630
and I feel like they
might be about to fall,

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:23.510
but I still feel like all
is right with the world.

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:28.700
And it's just one of the most
comfortable places to be.

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:33.200
And today, when I know that my
son is outside playing soccer,

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.250
and I hear the sound
of shattering glass,

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.240
I close my eyes.

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:41.390
I take a deep breath, and
I go to my good place,

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:42.590
which is your office.

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:43.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:45.860
That's the safe place.

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.030
That's the safe place in me.

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:50.360
So you've been--

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:53.610
Alan was saying
something to that effect,

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:57.770
but you've been a role model
in all aspects of my life.

00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:59.690
You've taught me
a lot of things.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:01.670
You've taught me--
you've shown me

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:05.750
how to give without
thinking about taking.

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:10.220
You taught me how to
always find a positive way

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.560
when you need to say
something and how

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.470
it's especially important to
find a positive way to answer

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:18.530
a question that wasn't
necessarily asked

00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:21.890
in a positive way.

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:25.970
You taught me a lot about always
remembering about what matters.

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:31.220
I remember I was lamenting
to you how my videos--

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:35.240
how other math videos on YouTube
get thousands of times more

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.280
views than my videos.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:42.250
And you said, views, yes,
but how many memories?

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:48.230
And I just want to say that guys
are so lucky because you will

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:52.820
remember this class, and you
will remember this experience,

00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:54.350
and you will have
these memories,

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:58.250
and thanks for teaching me that
it's the memories that count

00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:59.120
and not the views.

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:03.530
And I never thought about views
again after that conversation.

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:08.060
Now, you also-- what
I really appreciate

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:11.150
is that you're always
forthcoming with advice

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:12.630
when it's badly needed.

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.290
And I'll just relate one story.

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:18.170
When you were over at
our house for dinner

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:21.680
and you learned that my kitchen
had been under construction

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.560
for a year and making
very slow progress,

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.170
you looked me straight
in the eye and said,

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:30.350
Pavel, your family
needs a kitchen.

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:33.720
And a month later, my
kitchen was completed,

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:37.610
and I needed to
hear that, and this

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:40.160
is the mildest of
all examples when

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.880
you recognize that I
needed input from you,

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.330
and you gave it.

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:48.077
So I'm thankful
for that very much.

00:56:48.077 --> 00:56:49.160
GILBERT STRANG: Thank you.

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.620
PAVEL GRINFELD: And my
wife thanks you too.

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:54.900
I just have two
more things to say.

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:57.920
So a few years ago,
you came to Drexel

00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.530
and gave a talk at
the Math Colloquium.

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:04.730
And you said, I'm about to use
two words that I may have never

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:07.580
used in a talk before,
and those words

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:10.460
were "theorem" and
"proof," which is quite

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.410
remarkable for a mathematician.

00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:15.200
And I think we all
appreciate how you

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.630
keep things unsophisticated.

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:19.675
Just look at this board--

00:57:19.675 --> 00:57:23.670
its clear, clear,
and clear and simple.

00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:28.668
And for a guy who only
talks about matrices,

00:57:28.668 --> 00:57:30.960
it's amazing that you are,
as I see it, one of the most

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.210
universal mathematicians.

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:36.750
And you have taught us
that a simple 3-by-3 matrix

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:41.740
can give us scientific insight.

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:46.060
And before you, "matrix"
was a dirty word.

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.330
And now I think we would
all be proud to have

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:52.390
a beautiful matrix
with special properties

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:55.030
at the center of
any of our papers.

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:56.980
And I think that
mathematicians used

00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:01.240
to look down on linear algebra,
but you were right all along

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.250
about how important
the subject is.

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:07.630
And I think ChatGPT and the
linear algebra behind it

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:09.220
looks down on us.

00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.200
So you had it right.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.940
So we're all very excited to
see what you will accomplish

00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:21.040
in your retirement, but I'm
sure that whatever it is,

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.710
you will be remembered not
just for your scientific

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:26.620
accomplishments but
for human decency.

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:30.770
And I might be biased
because I was your student,

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:33.177
but I think you were
the best, so thank you.

00:58:33.177 --> 00:58:34.010
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:35.093
GILBERT STRANG: Thank you.

00:58:35.093 --> 00:58:42.350


00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:44.115
Thank you, Pavel.

00:58:44.115 --> 00:58:45.365
Thanks, that was really great.

00:58:45.365 --> 00:58:49.610


00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:53.330
MICHEL GOEMANS: Let me say
a few quick ones since it's

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:55.550
almost the end of the hour.

00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:59.150
So I'm Michel Goemans,
and I am the head

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:00.380
of the math department.

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:05.600
And Gil's career at MIT has
just been extraordinary.

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:09.800
As he said, he has
been for 61 years

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.400
on the faculty in mathematics.

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:18.230
And that's actually more
than any other faculty

00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:23.150
member in the history of
the department and possibly

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:24.320
of the history of--

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:27.743
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:27.743 --> 00:59:29.210


00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:33.200
--and possibly even in the
history of MIT, but I didn't--

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.960
I couldn't check that.

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.670
And as he said, his
affiliation with MIT

00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:42.680
has been even
longer since he was

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:49.210
a math major from 1952 to 1955
and a Moore instructor from '59

00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:50.480
to '61.

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.190
Mathematics, as you
know, is everywhere

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:53.660
in engineering and science.

00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:55.850
And in that spirit,
Gil's mission

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:58.670
has been to educate
countless of students

00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:02.960
from everywhere on the planet
in linear algebra, calculus,

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.580
differential
equations, and, more

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:10.250
generally, applied mathematics
and computational science.

01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:12.150
I say everyone on the planet--

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.700
and, in fact, at the
beginning of this lecture,

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.530
I was checking on YouTube,
and I saw comments from people

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:22.070
in Kurdistan, Turkey, Russia,
Mongolia, Iran, Brazil,

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:26.060
Thailand, India, South Korea,
Nigeria, Germany, Malaysia,

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.850
Hong Kong, Bangladesh,
Philippines, Morocco, Greece,

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:33.020
Italy, China, Taiwan, Brazil,
Armenia, Indonesia, Croatia,

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:37.250
Egypt, and even my own
country of Belgium.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.800
His lectures are legendary.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.660
It's not a surprise that 450
students registered for 18.06

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.700
for the last term he
was teaching together

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.010
with Andrew Horning.

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:54.140
But students well
beyond the walls of MIT

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.560
have benefited from his classes.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:04.370
He was the first to
put lectures on OCW

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:08.900
as it started and has had--

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:16.700
his many courses on OCW attract
about 5,000 daily visits.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.840
That's pretty significant.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.540
And his videos
apparently have been seen

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.790
by more than 14 million people.

01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:29.280
That's quite remarkable.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.250
And as part of his
educational mission,

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:36.410
he has published over 17 books,
if I got the number right,

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:38.450
because it seems
that, every week,

01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:41.060
there is almost a new one.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:44.870
His impact on
mathematics has been--

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:46.940
and especially on
math education,

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.840
has been mind boggling.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.320
So I taught 18.06
many years ago.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.950
And before teaching, I
attended Gil's lectures just

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:57.830
to see his way of teaching.

01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:02.330
And his pedagogical style
is indeed really unique.

01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:08.360
I felt he's really good at
making students think and feel

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.510
like they discover the
concepts by themselves.

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:16.850
And if he seems sometimes lost
in front of the blackboard,

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:20.840
I quickly realized
it's just pretense.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.400
He knows exactly what
he's talking about.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:29.630
And I should say also
that, as department head,

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:34.430
I often meet alumni, MIT Alumni,
whether they are math majors

01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:36.320
or from other disciplines.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.810
And quite often
they say, oh, I have

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:43.100
this memorable class at MIT.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.140
The name was, uh, ah--

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.370
Gil Strang.

01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:51.750
And then they say, oh, he must
be retired by now, decades ago.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:55.940
And I say, no, no,
he's still here.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:01.190
But finally, I'll be able to
say, yes, he has retired now.

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:03.080
GILBERT STRANG: I'm
sorry to hear that.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.550
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:09.140
MICHEL GOEMANS: So I've
been in this department

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:13.370
for half of his tenure, and he
has been an amazingly pleasant

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:13.940
colleague.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:15.800
He is so humble.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.950
And so after 61 years
at the Institute,

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:21.150
we'll miss him and his teaching.

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:23.300
But I think he fully
deserves retirement.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.640
So please join me in
congratulating Gil

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.300
for his lifelong
dedication to mathematics

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.400
and his education in MIT.

GILBERT STRANG: Oh.

01:03:56.310 --> 01:04:00.660
[LAUGHS] Thank you all.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.780
This is really an
unforgettable day for me.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:04.500
Thank you.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.930
And thank you, Michel.

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:07.980
Good.

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:08.645
Very good.

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:11.940


01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.340
So he believes I'm
going to retire.

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:15.930
I'm going to think about it.

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:18.760
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.010
So thank you all.

MICHEL GOEMANS:
We've gone overtime.

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:33.510
We should try to
empty the classroom.

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:34.010
Very good.

GILBERT STRANG: Oh, very
welcome, yeah, yeah.

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:45.810


01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:46.310
Good.

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:48.710
Could you take care of the
class and send this to me?

01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:53.210


01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:54.710
No, thank you.

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:56.210
I like that.

01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:57.710
Oh, that's great.

01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:58.610
Thanks.

01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:01.010
Thank you.

01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:03.110
Oh, you too.

01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:07.310
If you get it by Thursday,
take it to office.

It's the best little moment in--
